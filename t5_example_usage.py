"""
Example script to show the usage of T5Wrapper to get the logit probabilities, given some labels from T5. Note that this is an
ad-hoc mechanism designed to work only with simple labels (labels that have single tokens). In case the label
is split into multiple tokens by the tokenizer - we compute the probabilities with the first token only.
